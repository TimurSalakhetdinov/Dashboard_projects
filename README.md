[**3. Creating a sales dashboard with returns**](https://github.com/TimurSalakhetdinov/Dashboard_projects/tree/main/Google_data_studio_project)

**Project Objective**

Collect a dashboard that will show products the dynamics and current situation regarding returns in the context of the general situation for products.

**Project Description**

The product team has a new quarterly task: working with returns. So that you can display returns analytics in dashboards, the IT team rolled out a new field in the table with orders (invoices) - order type (type).

Now there is not only income, but also returns. At the same time, return invoices are not the status of an old order, but new orders, which are manually added by the sales department twice a week, and now in dashboards, if you simply display the amount of revenue without a filter by order type, then each order for which a return was made is duplicated return invoice and each invoice has its own invoice_id.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, BigQuery, Google Data Studio
